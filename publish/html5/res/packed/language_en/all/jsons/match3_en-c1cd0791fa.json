  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text206": "We decided to stay and explore this new area but it makes sense to relax and enjoy ourselves before embarking on another journey.",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text207": "Everyone who seeks true adventure must hunt treasures at some point. Let's see what we can find!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text208": "We love to have fun and relax but discovering worlds is our all-time favorite activity! It looks like we've stumbled on something new once again.",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text209": "It's hot outside and it would be nice to go out for a swim but we have something else in mind and we need your help...",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text210": "You helped us a lot on our countless journeys. This time we just want to invite you to have some tea with us. Don't worry. It's also going to be fun!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text211": "It was truly enjoyable when our friends showed us around where they live. Now it's our turn to do the same!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text212": "As much as we like to discover new worlds we also like to create our own. All it takes is just a little inspiration!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text213": "Our adventure continues! Only this time we decided not to limit it to exploring the land.",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text214": "What is the best way to travel? Crossing the bridges that connect different worlds. But you need to build them first!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text215": "There is one thing we cannot resist and it's visiting beautiful places! Once we get a chance to do that we instantly take it!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text216": "Is there a better way to spend a day than reading a book while sitting on a chocolate bench? We doubt it!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text217": "We always look for new adventures and when the road calls us we don't say no to its invitation!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text218": "Everyone has a dream. It just so happens that ours is riding a gingerbread carriage on the biscuit paved street.",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text219": "We like to try new things and challenge ourselves. Please, support us on our newest endavour!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text220": "Looking for new adventures can be very exciting but is this the only way to have fun? We happen to know something as thrilling!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text221": "It's time for us to go out and collect some treats and we definitely need your help!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text222": "We’ve got ourselves into the Dessert forest but it’s too dark here so we have some trouble getting out. Please help!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text223": "Now that we are out of the Dessert Forest it's time to take a minute and dream about future adventures.",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text224": "Are you also curious what awaits for us on the other side? There is only one way to find out!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text225": "The view is always better from the top! Join us at the Waffle Castle to see for yourself.",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text226": "It looks like winter is coming. Instead of being sad about it, we are going to take advantage of it. Join us!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text227": "Who says that winter can't be cozy? With a cup of hot fresh cocoa outside can be even warmer than the inside!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text228": "Winter was made for having fun so we're going to take full advantage of it!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text229": "We love to explore Candyland in the winter. It's always a lot of fun and magical discoveries!",
  "StartEpisodeWindow.Text230": "Nothing is as wonderful and magical as Christmas in the Candyland! Come with us and see for yourself",
  
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Title": "Episode completed",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text0": "It is so much fun playing with you! Let’s embark on the new adventures! To the unexplored lands!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text1": "We did it! Donut is very grateful for your help. We hope you had as much fun as we did! Go on to find more challenging levels to play!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text2": "It is great that we are leaving the territory of cold behind. Let’s keep moving because it will keep us warm!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text3": "How is it going? I hope you spent enough time here and now you are ready for the next adventure!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text4": "We had so much fun fishing! I am pretty sure there are more exciting adventures to come!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text5": "Wow! We have so many butterflies from that meadow! I believe they could be our new friends! Are you ready for the new adventure?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text6": "How are you? We've met a very funny Donut Archer! But the new adventure will not reveal itself until we go for it!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text7": "I think we should move further. Do you agree? Well, let's go then!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text8": "Ho-ho! A brave traveler like yourself never looks back!  Let's see what awaits us next!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text9": "It's a miracle! You solved all these riddles so fast! I don't know anyone else who is as good at it as we are!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text10": "You're a true traveler who would prefer to go straight ahead to staying in one place for so long! Let's go!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text11": "How do you like the Sweet Empire? It's so sweet, isn't it? Well, time to make one more step ahead in our adventure!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text12": "Well done! Let's see what is about to happen next! Nothing can surprise me after all our adventures!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text13": "We can stay here forever but there's a time and place for playing. We should go further to find new adventures!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text14": "Oh! There are so many sweets here! It's just too much for us at the moment! I think we should go ahead otherwise we might get stuck!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text15": "I hope you enjoyed this place as much as I did! But there is not much else to do here. Let's go!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text16": "It's so loud here! We have got everything we needed here! Let's move!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text17": "Phew! Thank God we didn't break anything! I think you will remember this place for a long time!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text18": "Such a nice day! I am having so much fun! You too? Awesome! Let's face new adventures!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text19": "Phew! Did you notice that having fun is a lot harder than working? But more enjoyable too!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text20": "You're a great traveler! You should definetly write a book about our adventure! Don't forget to include me in it!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text21": "Such a wonderful place! But it's also dangerous... Once you've started it's so hard to stop! Let's go forward to see what's waiting for us!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text22": "So delicious, isn't it? Be careful, it is difficult to get off it! Let's go on!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text23": "This place is nice but don't forget that adventures are waiting for us!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text24": "You can wander here forever. It is better to keep moving forward, isn't it?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text25": "It's nice to have a rest sometimes! But it's much better to move forward!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text26": "So nice being here but it's getting colder, isn't it? Let's go forward to warm up!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text27": "It's always nice to sit on top of the world but to move towards your goal you have to go down sometimes!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text28": "It nice seeing you handle everything with such ease! Don't you think it's time to move to the next step of your journey?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text29": "Almost got caught! All is well that ends well. We'd better keep moving or we might end up waking up the dragon!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text30": "Well, how is it feeling? I'm sure you're as happy as I am! But let's not overstay our welcome here. Adventures will not wait!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text31": "Such a nice place! It's so good that we've been here! Let's move forward to the new adventure!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text32": "Wow! You're the best traveler! It's a nice feeling, isn't it?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text33": "Amazing! It is a very, very nice place! So shiny, so sweet, so cozy! But it's time to move further!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text34": "It's a very nice place but it's time to get outside and enjoy the sun! Let's go, to the new achievements!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text35": "Oh! Is there anything better than fresh air and nice sounds of waterfall bubbles! Let's see what we've got ahead of us!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text36": "Are you happy? Me too! It was such a good place to camp during a long journey! Let's move on!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text37": "It's a beautiful place with wonderful views! But adventure awaits!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text38": "Such a great place to enjoy! Do you have a bad seasickness history? Nice! Let's go then!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text39": "Great! This place makes you feel like a newborn! I have so much energy for further adventures!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text40": "Woo hoo! It's a big step for us! We did it. It wasn't that difficult after all!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text41": "Well done! Can you hear the adventure calling us? Me too!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text42": "Yeah! We've walked this path without losses! I can already see the exit light! Come on!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text43": "Wow! Everything went without a hitch! Can you handle the next episode as well as this one?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text44": "Ugh! It was not that easy... But you have got everything under control as you always do! Great job!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text45": "It was amazing! It is truly an unbelievable place! Let's go find out what's next!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text46": "Well done! This is a very nice place but we can't stay! Let's go! There are even more amazing places waiting for us!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text47": "Wow! I feel so refreshed! Are you ready to move forward? Me too - let's go!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text48": "Such a peaceful place. And quite too! Let's find some new adventures to shake things up!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text49": "Ugh! I hope you did not get wet! It is good that we are always keep moving!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text50": "Wow! It's a good place to relax! Let's rest for a while and go on to our next adventure!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text51": "I don't want to leave this spot but we must keep moving  because the only thing that makes a good journey is the discovery of new places!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text52": "You're doing great managing your business! I hope you  had some fun? Time to move on!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text53": "Wow! Now we are ready for a spaceflight! Three, two, one...",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text54": "I see that you are quite good at navigating the space! I wonder what's the next adventure waiting for us?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text55": "Wow! Congratulations, you have done it! I think we should move on!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text56": "The landing was successful! I think we are ready for further adventures!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text57": "It is a beautiful day today, isn't it? And wonderful new acquaintances! I wonder who we'll meet next?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text58": "You did it! I hope you didn't bask in the Sun too much because new adventure is about to begin!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text59": "Nice weather and nice company is a perfect combination for a traveler!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text60": "I don't think there is much else we can do here! Let's go further!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text61": "Nice moves! I can see that you are really enjoying the park! But don't stay at one place for too long. Let's keep moving!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text62": "Great job! Curious to know what is next?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text63": "Well done! It would be great to stay here longer but new adventures are waiting for us!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text64": "I really don't want to leave this place! But we have a lot of interesting adventures ahead of us!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text65": "Wow! We have accomplished everything we had to do! Well, it's time to go!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text66": "Such a hospitality! I don't want to leave but the true traveler can't stand still!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text67": "Amazing! I knew that we wouldn't stay here for too long. It's time to go further!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text68": "Well rested and fully reinvigorated, let's go forward!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text69": "A perfect place! I think we should visit such places more often!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text70": "It would be nice to sit all day long watching the stars. But on the second thought we don't want to miss the adventure, do we?!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text71": "As I said, there are no obstacles we can't overcome! It's time to move on.",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text72": "It's so exciting to discover new places. What awaits us next?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text73": "What do you think awaits us next? Something even more interesting for sure!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text74": "I am so glad that we have learned to cope with such difficulties!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text75": "Do you think we deserve some fish for our efforts? I think we do!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text76": "Excellent! I had no doubts that we will succeed!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text77": "Magnificent snow plains are so terribly captivating that I can't stop looking at them!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text78": "It's a pleasure to walk with you! We visited so many interesting places!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text79": "It is nice to have fun under the light of garlands accompanied by the song of ice!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text80": "Enough of reminiscing the old memories! Let's go! New challenges await!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text81": "The movement is life itself. It keeps you warm and brings fun to you!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text82": "Wow, I am totally warmed up now! What is next?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text83": "I had such a wonderful time walking with you. This journey wouldn't be the same without you!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text84": "Well played! I think we deserve the first place!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text85": "I don't want to leave this wonderful castle! But adventure is calling!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text86": "To rest is always good but to rest in a beautiful place is twice as good!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text87": "Not bad! I am certain there is more to come!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text88": "This adventure is sheer fun. Surely there are more miracles waiting for us!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text89": "The locals are so wonderful! Well, it couldn't have been any other way!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text90": "We can just live here at our leisure! But it's not the travellers way. Let's go!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text91": "It's time to move on but we'll definitely come back here later!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text92": "The inhabitants of the Candyland are so pleasant! I am pretty sure we will meet them again one day!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text93": "Well played! I think you'll overcome any obstacle on your way!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text94": "What a wonderful weather! And what a great company to go on with our journey!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text95": "Wow, it was quite pacy! But we managed! As always!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text96": "We did a good job! But it is no time to stand still. There are many places where we can help!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text97": "What a wonderful day to share all of your feelings!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text98": "Such a warm welcome! I didn't know that our hero told so much about our adventures!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text99": "Wow! Our heroes have seen so much in their travels! Let's not fall behind! Go ahead!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text100": "It seems like everything is so simple but, in fact, our magician is just very strong in the battle!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text101": "What a delightful place! It is so peaceful and fresh here. But it's time to go!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text102": "I've always been fascinated by the mountains! A real traveler will never miss a chance to reach another summit!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text103": "Such a wonderful place! Seems like you can walk here forever. But we have to go!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text104": "Hooray! The civilians are rescued and may the moonlight always lit up their way!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text105": "Great! The tanks are full and we're ready to embark on our journey! Fasten your seat belts! Let's roll!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text106": "We’ve had a great time! It’s okay if you feel like taking a break after such a demanding task but you can also keep moving which is always more fun!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text107": "Hopefully, the sweet tooth raccoon is pleased with all the sweets we've collected for him!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text108": "Excellent! I always knew that we were born to help others! Our trip just became even better!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text109": "It is time for a well deserved treat! We have to try these delicious granny’s pies!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text110": "We really loved playing with you! Come again soon, we'll be waiting for you!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text111": "It is such a beautiful place! It would have been so nice to just stay here but the real traveler lives for a chance to move forward!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text112": "What an amazing place! We will be definitely coming back here!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text113": "We can’t just sit around even when we are on a vacation! And I love that about us!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text114": "We did just fine! The cute animals were satisfied! And this was the most important part of our journey. To make the world a better place!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text115": "We are finished! And I must say we've done a pretty great job. We can relax at last. But not for long.",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text116": "Soon enough the lighthouse will be lit! It is a pity that we have to move forward. But we will see this beautiful sight later anyway!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text117": "The task is not as simple as it seemed at first! I think we will have to get assistance. Let's go and find some help!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text118": "We did a right thing! And now we are ready for new adventures! Let's move!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text119": "Not bad! Training is good but the fun training is twice as better! There are even more exciting things ahead of us!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text120": "Great job! The first prize is almost in our pocket!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text121": "It is nice to travel when you can freshen up! Are you ready to continue?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text122": "Perfect! I think we are ready to go on with our journey! Let's go and face new adventures!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text123": "It's so good to meet an old friend who will help you get through the mysterious land!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text124": "Well done! All these stars will suffice to fill the whole sky. And what can be better than having your own night horizon!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text125": "The second we became friends all these obstacles stopped being difficult and we overcame them all together! I wonder what awaits us next?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text126": "Great! This will be enough for my signature cocktail. And these Ice strawberries indeed came in handy!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text127": "We are as good as always! Now all the doors are open for our hero! I am so excited to see where this path will lead him?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text128": "What an incredible skill you have! All the tests were passed honorably and now we can move on. I have heard that no one else was able to handle this trail as well as we did!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text129": "You deserve to wear this band. Be ready for the new challenges the chosen path will bring you. But remember, great power means great responsibility!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text130": "I always knew that we wouldn't leave anyone in danger! I wonder what risks lie ahead?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text131": "Great! We have managed to help the little inventor despite all the difficulties. Our deed won't be left unnoticed!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text132": "It is so nice to help the ones in need! Even when you don't get rewarded for it. Don't you think so?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text133": "Turns out that our Jelly is not the only one who loves to live in the clouds! The most important thing is to strive for your dream!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text134": "I am glad that our friend is not one of those Jellies who gets above oneself after the first victory! And now it's time to hit the road and greet new adventures!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text135": "Well, well, well, let's be careful. A little bit of discretion and thoughtfulness and we will soon know what we've found!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text136": "Oh! It seems that all of the equipment is set up and ready for the experiment. Shall we begin? Three, two, one...",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text137": "Wow! We are as strong as our hero! But it's no time to celebrate, it's time to move on!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text138": "Wonderful! We passed all the tests together with our hero! I can already hear the new adventure calling us! Let's go!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text139": "I would never have thought that the itsy-bitsy magic is so mesmerizing although I have seen the magic of much greater scale!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text140": "I really enjoy watching at such tricks! Sometimes I even think that there is nothing as beautiful as that!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text141": "The wizard is always ready to help the ones in need! Here you are, Little Jelly, come take your ice cream!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text142": "It wouldn't be such a bad idea to relax for a while after dealing with all these magical affairs! What do you think? Let's do it!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text143": "It's so nice around here! The glitter of crystals reflecting from the twinkling of stars - what could be more beautiful... Let's try and find out?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text144": "It's amazing! It also benefits magic crystals - they change their color nicely!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text145": "We've had a great time! But it's time to pack our things and hit the road! Let's go!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text146": "We soared above the clouds! Just look at the view in front of us! It's so beautiful here!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text147": "Seems like we did a good job! Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think we need to rest before our next adventure! Let's go!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text148": "Interesting games never bore us! Ready to set off on a new adventure?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text149": "How wonderful it was for us to overcome all these obstacles! Well, for experienced travelers like us there’s nothing to it!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text150": "It was delicious! Games and bubbles! Sometimes, it seems to me that there is nothing better than sweets and games!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text151": "These obstacles were not so difficult. I think we should find something more harder for such masters as we are!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text152": "Well played! Once again you prove your skill! It is always nice to see a professional in your field!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text153": "How wonderful when adventure awaits us at every turn! So, to stop there is definitely not worth it!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text154": "Wow, that was an exciting adventure! It seems we are just born for magic ... Maybe we should become wizards too?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text155": "Fine! We managed just in time! I wonder what lies ahead.",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text156": "What an adventure! Now it’s clear for sure - in the next episode we won’t be bored!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text157": "Hooray! Victory! Looks like we set a new track record! But do not rest on your laurels when no less wonderful adventures await you!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text158": "Excellent! It seems to me that local scientists could not have done without us! Hooray!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text159": "Wow! We are real caramel anglers! It seems we can do any job on the shoulder!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text160": "That's why I like biscuit fields, because you can frolic fame for them! But we have to go further!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text161": "It's so nice to play together! No time to stop - new games will be even more interesting!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text162": "Such wonderful aromas soar around! They are beckoning and asking to stay a little longer. But we have to go ahead!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text163": "It turns out that games are the best way to relieve fatigue! Maybe we shouldn't stop?",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text164": "How cleverly we went through all the obstacles. We are are ready to move on. Let's go!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text165": "It's so wonderful to make miracles! Let's hurry on, where we can apply new knowledge!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text166": "How good it is to rest in the fresh air! But the main thing in the adventure is to be in motion!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text167": "Here we are at the beach! Now you can relax, and then continue our journey!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text168": "Wow! I have not seen such wonderful beds for a long time! It seems that the local farmers harvest was a success!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text169": "Great! It seems like everything is about to start so we need to hurry if we want to make it in time.",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text170": "Wow! It turns out that we are pretty good at decorating things. I can't wait to get to the party itself! Let's bounce!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text171": "Hurrah! It was unforgettable! The holiday was a success, and sweets will last for a long time!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text172": "We've had the sweetest time! The memories about this evening will fill us up with joy wherever we'll go next. By the way, it's time to move!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text173": "Well, it was all a dream although it felt so real! But now we're awake and full of energy for new accomplishments!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text174": "It turned out masterfully! Let's see what will happen next? Hope something very interesting!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text175": "As much as we enjoy breathing in candy flowered aroma we need to move on! Hopefully thhe smell will stay with us for a while!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text176": "We've had so much fun and we're so excited about what happens next! With the power of snow on our side we're ready for new miracles!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text177": "Wow, that was fast! And very, very cool. Too bad we have to go already!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text178": "All that preparation got me in the mood for celebration! I can't wait for festivities to start now!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text179": "I guess we have enough candies to make our Christmas tree look delicious and to even treat ourselves to some cupcakes!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text180": "It was a fantastic journey into the sky which we'll always cherish! Now it's the time for the next chapter of our incredible adventure!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text181": "It was unbelievable! I hope that we and our new friend will have a great time celebrating and spreading around the Christmas spirit!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text182": "It would've been nice to stay here for a while and enjoy the serenity of local streams but the most exciting part our journey is still ahead of us",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text183": "This was wonderful! Is it possible to top that? We shall find out very soon!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text184": "It was quite a remarkable part of our journey! Now we are looking forward to even more!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text185": "New emotions, new friends and new experiences! This is the way to spend time and we can't get enough of it! Let's find another adventure!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text186": "We can't explain how did we get here but we were destined to do just that. Let's see where our curiosity takes us next!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text187": "Thanks for letting us savour the moment and giving us a chance to catch our breath. Now we are ready for new challenges!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text188": "There is always a place for sweet feelings in the candy kingdom!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text189": "Just as we predicted! Nobody wants to leave this place but the adventure calls. And it tastes better than anything!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text190": "Although it's so relaxing and satisfying it's also kind of boring. We weren't made to idle. We are destined to be the greatest travelers in the world! Let's roll!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text191": "Although it's very nice to be surrounded by this colorful nature we can't help ourselves but think where does this bridge lead? Let's find out!",

  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text216": "Thank you for keeping us company! You collected enough sweets to build a chocolate bench for everyone.",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text217": "It's always better to travel together because you can share the excitement with your friends. Thank you for being a part of it all!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text218": "Thank you for helping us realize our dream! It would've been impossible to assemble the carriage without all the sweets you collected.",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text219": "It wasn't easy to climb this ladder while avoiding sticky caramel but we made it thanks to you. With friends like this anything is possible!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text220": "We hope that you had as much fun swinging as we did! It was totally awesome and we can't wait to find even more ways to enjoy life!",

  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text228": "We had a great time with our snowball fight! We hope you can join us for our next adventure!",
  "FinishEpisodeWindow.Text229": "We hope that you enjoyed it as much as we did because it's now time to dig even deeper!",
