I think we should visit such places more often!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text70":"It would be nice to sit all day long watching the stars.

Surely there are more miracles waiting for us!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text89":"The locals are so wonderful! Well, it couldn't have been any other way!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text90":"We can just live here at our leisure! But it's not the travellers way. Let's go!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text91":"It's time to move on but we'll definitely come back here later!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text92":"The inhabitants of the Candyland are so pleasant! I am pretty sure we will meet them again one day!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text93":"Well played! I think you'll overcome any obstacle on your way!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text94":"What a wonderful weather!

It is so peaceful and fresh here. But it's time to go!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text102":"I've always been fascinated by the mountains!

The tanks are full and we're ready to embark on our journey! Fasten your seat belts! Let's roll!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text106":"We’ve had a great time!

We will be definitely coming back here!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text113":"We can’t just sit around even when we are on a vacation! And I love that about us!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text114":"We did just fine! The cute animals were satisfied! And this was the most important part of our journey. To make the world a better place!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text115":"We are finished! And I must say we've done a pretty great job. We can relax at last. But not for long.","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text116":"Soon enough the lighthouse will be lit! It is a pity that we have to move forward. But we will see this beautiful sight later anyway!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text117":"The task is not as simple as it seemed at first! I think we will have to get assistance. Let's go and find some help!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text118":"We did a right thing! And now we are ready for new adventures! Let's move!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text119":"Not bad! Training is good but the fun training is twice as better! There are even more exciting things ahead of us!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text120":"Great job! The first prize is almost in our pocket!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text121":"It is nice to travel when you can freshen up! Are you ready to continue?","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text122":"Perfect! I think we are ready to go on with our journey! Let's go and face new adventures!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text123":"It's so good to meet an old friend who will help you get through the mysterious land!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text124":"Well done! All these stars will suffice to fill the whole sky. And what can be better than having your own night horizon!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text125":"The second we became friends all these obstacles stopped being difficult and we overcame them all together! I wonder what awaits us next?","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text126":"Great! This will be enough for my signature cocktail. And these Ice strawberries indeed came in handy!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text127":"We are as good as always! Now all the doors are open for our hero! I am so excited to see where this path will lead him?","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text128":"What an incredible skill you have! All the tests were passed honorably and now we can move on. I have heard that no one else was able to handle this trail as well as we did!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text129":"You deserve to wear this band. Be ready for the new challenges the chosen path will bring you. But remember, great power means great responsibility!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text130":"I always knew that we wouldn't leave anyone in danger! I wonder what risks lie ahead?","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text131":"Great! We have managed to help the little inventor despite all the difficulties. Our deed won't be left unnoticed!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text132":"It is so nice to help the ones in need! Even when you don't get rewarded for it. Don't you think so?","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text133":"Turns out that our Jelly is not the only one who loves to live in the clouds! The most important thing is to strive for your dream!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text134":"I am glad that our friend is not one of those Jellies who gets above oneself after the first victory! And now it's time to hit the road and greet new adventures!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text135":"Well, well, well, let's be careful. A little bit of discretion and thoughtfulness and we will soon know what we've found!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text136":"Oh! It seems that all of the equipment is set up and ready for the experiment. Shall we begin? Three, two, one...","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text137":"Wow! We are as strong as our hero! But it's no time to celebrate, it's time to move on!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text138":"Wonderful! We passed all the tests together with our hero! I can already hear the new adventure calling us! Let's go!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text139":"I would never have thought that the itsy-bitsy magic is so mesmerizing although I have seen the magic of much greater scale!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text140":"I really enjoy watching at such tricks! Sometimes I even think that there is nothing as beautiful as that!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text141":"The wizard is always ready to help the ones in need! Here you are, Little Jelly, come take your ice cream!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text142":"It wouldn't be such a bad idea to relax for a while after dealing with all these magical affairs! What do you think? Let's do it!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text143":"It's so nice around here! The glitter of crystals reflecting from the twinkling of stars - what could be more beautiful... Let's try and find out?","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text144":"It's amazing! It also benefits magic crystals - they change their color nicely!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text145":"We've had a great time! But it's time to pack our things and hit the road! Let's go!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text146":"We soared above the clouds! Just look at the view in front of us! It's so beautiful here!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text147":"Seems like we did a good job! Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think we need to rest before our next adventure! Let's go!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text148":"Interesting games never bore us! Ready to set off on a new adventure?","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text149":"How wonderful it was for us to overcome all these obstacles! Well, for experienced travelers like us there’s nothing to it!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text150":"It was delicious! Games and bubbles! Sometimes, it seems to me that there is nothing better than sweets and games!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text151":"These obstacles were not so difficult. I think we should find something more harder for such masters as we are!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text152":"Well played! Once again you prove your skill! It is always nice to see a professional in your field!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text153":"How wonderful when adventure awaits us at every turn! So, to stop there is definitely not worth it!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text154":"Wow, that was an exciting adventure! It seems we are just born for magic ... Maybe we should become wizards too?","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text155":"Fine! We managed just in time! I wonder what lies ahead.","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text156":"What an adventure! Now it’s clear for sure - in the next episode we won’t be bored!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text157":"Hooray! Victory! Looks like we set a new track record! But do not rest on your laurels when no less wonderful adventures await you!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text158":"Excellent! It seems to me that local scientists could not have done without us! Hooray!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text159":"Wow! We are real caramel anglers! It seems we can do any job on the shoulder!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text160":"That's why I like biscuit fields, because you can frolic fame for them! But we have to go further!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text161":"It's so nice to play together! No time to stop - new games will be even more interesting!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text162":"Such wonderful aromas soar around! They are beckoning and asking to stay a little longer. But we have to go ahead!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text163":"It turns out that games are the best way to relieve fatigue! Maybe we shouldn't stop?","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text164":"How cleverly we went through all the obstacles. We are are ready to move on. Let's go!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text165":"It's so wonderful to make miracles! Let's hurry on, where we can apply new knowledge!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text166":"How good it is to rest in the fresh air! But the main thing in the adventure is to be in motion!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text167":"Here we are at the beach! Now you can relax, and then continue our journey!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text168":"Wow! I have not seen such wonderful beds for a long time! It seems that the local farmers harvest was a success!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text169":"Great! It seems like everything is about to start so we need to hurry if we want to make it in time.","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text170":"Wow! It turns out that we are pretty good at decorating things. I can't wait to get to the party itself! Let's bounce!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text171":"Hurrah! It was unforgettable! The holiday was a success, and sweets will last for a long time!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text172":"We've had the sweetest time! The memories about this evening will fill us up with joy wherever we'll go next. By the way, it's time to move!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text173":"Well, it was all a dream although it felt so real! But now we're awake and full of energy for new accomplishments!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text174":"It turned out masterfully! Let's see what will happen next? Hope something very interesting!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text175":"As much as we enjoy breathing in candy flowered aroma we need to move on! Hopefully thhe smell will stay with us for a while!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text176":"We've had so much fun and we're so excited about what happens next! With the power of snow on our side we're ready for new miracles!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text177":"Wow, that was fast! And very, very cool. Too bad we have to go already!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text178":"All that preparation got me in the mood for celebration! I can't wait for festivities to start now!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text179":"I guess we have enough candies to make our Christmas tree look delicious and to even treat ourselves to some cupcakes!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text180":"It was a fantastic journey into the sky which we'll always cherish! Now it's the time for the next chapter of our incredible adventure!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text181":"It was unbelievable! I hope that we and our new friend will have a great time celebrating and spreading around the Christmas spirit!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text182":"It would've been nice to stay here for a while and enjoy the serenity of local streams but the most exciting part our journey is still ahead of us","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text183":"This was wonderful! Is it possible to top that? We shall find out very soon!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text184":"It was quite a remarkable part of our journey! Now we are looking forward to even more!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text185":"New emotions, new friends and new experiences! This is the way to spend time and we can't get enough of it! Let's find another adventure!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text186":"We can't explain how did we get here but we were destined to do just that. Let's see where our curiosity takes us next!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text187":"Thanks for letting us savour the moment and giving us a chance to catch our breath. Now we are ready for new challenges!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text188":"There is always a place for sweet feelings in the candy kingdom!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text189":"Just as we predicted! Nobody wants to leave this place but the adventure calls. And it tastes better than anything!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text190":"Although it's so relaxing and satisfying it's also kind of boring. We weren't made to idle. We are destined to be the greatest travelers in the world! Let's roll!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text191":"Although it's very nice to be surrounded by this colorful nature we can't help ourselves but think where does this bridge lead? Let's find out!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text192":"Well, it looks like a beginning of some new adventure. Our hopes are up and our spirits are high. Let's find out what's next!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text193":"We're glad that we seized this opportunity to spend some time alone with nature. This gave us the energy we'll need on the next leg of the journey!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text194":"The celebration is coming to an end! But it doesn't mean that the fun has to stop. We can feel the presence of adventure in the air!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text195":"It was great staying at grandma's house! You can't find as many delicious treats as she has in the whole wide Candyland! But we'll try!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text196":"It turns out that if you're friendly to others others will be friendly to you! This lesson will come in handy when we continue our journey.","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text197":"That was so much fun! We hope to see even more gorgeous flowers on our way. As for now, let's carry this amazing scent with us and let others enjoy it.","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text198":"How cool was that! Hopefully, one day we'll have a chance to build the house of our own for others to awe. As for now, the adventure is calling!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text199":"We’ve decided to let the faith choose for us. Was going right the right decision? We’ll find out soon enough!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text200":"There are many new adventures ahead of us but one thing is for sure. Every acquaintance on our way makes the experience so much better!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text201":"We should thank our friend for keeping us on track because it's easy to get lost while gazing at the landmarks. Let's find out where she takes us next!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text202":"The photo turned out just perfect! A simple act of looking at it will give us the strength we need to go that extra mile when another great journey requires that of us.","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text203":"It seems like we've seen all there is to see. We doubt that anything will ever top our encounter with the Rainbow Unicorn but we're willing to find out!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text204":"This was a perfect journey through the most wonderful ice crystals and sundae rivers. We can't wait to see what's coming next!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text205":"Once again our rule paid off. We had a great time and enjoyed every second of it! We hope you did too because it's time to go now.","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text206":"Fully rested, we are ready to see what this place has to offer. Let's get the most out of this wonderful opportunity!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text207":"Our loot is delicious. Thank you for helping us to collect all these sweets. We will see you on another island!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text208":"We live for exploring new places and cultures. Thank you for being a part of our team on this journey!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text209":"Instead of going to the lake like everyone else we decided to visit one of our favorite places. Thank you for coming with us!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text210":"Thank you for joining us! We had a lovely time together. Now we feel like going somewhere else. We hope that you'll come with us!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text211":"We've had a great time sightseeing but it's far from the end. We have lots more to witness!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text212":"Thanks for taking part in our amazing adventure. We hope that we can do even greater things in the future!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text213":"It feels great to expand the horizons and see new things. There is no better way to do it than embracing the spirit of history!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text214":"We had a lot of fun building the chocolate bridge together. Thank you for your help. It's about time we cross it!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text215":"We're so happy that you're keeping us company on our journeys. We're sure that many more lie ahead of us!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text216":"Thank you for keeping us company! You collected enough sweets to build a chocolate bench for everyone.","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text217":"It's always better to travel together because you can share the excitement with your friends. Thank you for being a part of it all!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text218":"Thank you for helping us realize our dream! It would've been impossible to assemble the carriage without all the sweets you collected.","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text219":"It wasn't easy to climb this ladder while avoiding sticky caramel but we made it thanks to you. With friends like this anything is possible!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text220":"We hope that you had as much fun swinging as we did! It was totally awesome and we can't wait to find even more ways to enjoy life!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text221":"Thank you so much! It looks like we have enough treats to continue our exciting journey!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text222":"Thank you so much for rescuing us on such a short notice!

And judging by the number of sweets we collected you did!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text226":"It was a lot of fun playing together! We hope that we can keep doing that even when there is more snow.","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text227":"It was nice to enjoy some hot beverages and having fun at the rink but it's now time to move on!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text228":"We had a great time with our snowball fight! We hope you can join us for our next adventure!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text229":"We hope that you enjoyed it as much as we did because it's now time to dig even deeper!","FinishEpisodeWindow.Text230":"We hope that the next year will bring us even more delicious sweets that we will share with everyone!","NativeInstallWindow.title":"Get the app!","NativeInstallWindow.text":"The game is available on your device!
